# Airtel_Telecom_Churn
Consumer Behavior Analysis for Targeted Retention Initiatives in Telecom sector

## Objectives 
 Analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.
     
### Business Understanding
 - If the customer is likely to churn, then firm can increase focus and target marketing towards these customers to avoid business loss.
 
 - The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a customer is likely to churn, which may be used for taking actions such as providing better offers, resolving services related issues quickly etc

### Data Understanding
 - The dataset contains customer-level information for a span of four consecutive months - June, July, August and September. The months are encoded as 6, 7, 8 and 9 respectively.
 
The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months. To do this task well, understanding the typical customer behaviour during churn will be helpful.

High-value Churn - Approximately 80% of revenue comes from the top 20% customers (called high-value customers). Thus, if we can reduce churn of the high-value customers, we will be able to reduce significant revenue leakage.

Here, we will predict churn only on high-value customers.
